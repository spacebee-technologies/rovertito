# Rovertito Project

Rovertito is a modular, autonomous mini lunar vehicle (mass < 2 kg) with the mission to find underground water and lava tubes, which are critical for human survival. And itâ€™s open source!

It is the first (but certainly not the last!) moon rover developed by our team at Spacebee Technologies, winners of the [2020 Open Space Moon rover challenge](https://spaceisopen.com/eng/)

This repository holds the code for the rover's microcontroller. You can find the other modules of this project (OBC code, mechanical & electronics, etc) at our org's [other repos](https://github.com/orgs/spacebee-technologies/repositories) (in construction).

## Missions

- Find subterranean water reservoirs.
- Detect and characterize lava tubes (hollow structures suitable for human shelter) below the lunar soil.
- Create an open source framework of a modular rover which works as baseline for future projects.
- Develop the first ultra-low-cost and open-source Moon rover capable of carrying out its mission autonomously and communicating with other rovers, conforming a hive.
- Generate a database of images of the Moon terrain and other measurements to boost future implementations of Deep Learning algorithms.

##  Electronics

The brain of the rover is a microcontroller of the SAMV71 family that controls different subsystems.

## How To Get Involved ##

- The Rovertito project is open source and we encourage participation and code contributions: [guidelines for contributors to the Rovertito codebase](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- This project is currently in its early stages and the software team is small and just getting started, so help is really appreciated, but please be patient.
